name: Giraffe
scientific_name: Giraffa camelopardalis
taxonomy:
  class: Mammalia
  order: Artiodactyla
  family: Giraffidae
size:
  length: 4.6-6.1 m (height)
  weight: 800-1200 kg
habitat: Savannas, open woodlands, and floodplains of sub-Saharan Africa
diet: Browsing herbivore (acacia leaves, shoots, seasonal fruits)
capabilities:
  - long_neck
  - prehensile_tongue
  - high_visual_acuity
  - ruminant_digestion
  - powerful_kick
behaviors:
  - name: forage
    description: Browse tree canopies for leaves and shoots using height advantage.
    inputs: vegetation_height, branch_density, time_of_day
    outputs: energy_gain, hydration_change
    constraints: 14-20 hours per day; slower intake during midday heat or heavy rain.
  - name: selective_browse
    description: Use prehensile tongue and lips to strip leaves while avoiding thorns.
    inputs: thorn_density, branch_diameter, reach_angle
    outputs: leaf_intake_rate, minor_thorn_contact
    constraints: Requires branches within 2.5-5.5 m height; reduced efficiency on dense thorns.
  - name: scan_horizon
    description: Raise head to survey surroundings for predators and herd location.
    inputs: ambient_light, wind_direction, herd_distance
    outputs: threat_alert_state, orientation_adjustment
    constraints: Performed every few minutes while feeding; extended duration when calves present.
  - name: ruminate
    description: Chew cud in a safe spot to improve digestion efficiency.
    inputs: time_since_last_feed, shelter_cover
    outputs: digestion_progress, reduced_movement_state
    constraints: 15-30 minute bouts several times daily; only when threat_alert_state is low.
  - name: defensive_kick
    description: Deliver a powerful kick toward approaching predators.
    inputs: threat_distance, target_position, stance_stability
    outputs: deterrence_signal, potential_injury_to_predator
    constraints: Triggered when threat_distance < 5 m; requires stable footing; high energy cost.
