  class: Mammalia
  order: Primates
  family: Hominidae
size:
  length: 1.25-1.8 m (standing height)
  weight: 100-220 kg
habitat: Tropical and subtropical forests of Central Africa
diet: Primarily herbivorous (leaves, stems, fruit)
capabilities:
  - knuckle_walking
  - strong_upper_body
  - opposable_thumbs
  - complex_social_structure
  - varied_vocalizations
behaviors:
  - name: forage
    description: Search for and consume leaves, stems, and seasonal fruit.
    inputs: vegetation_density, time_of_day
    outputs: energy_gain, hydration_change
    constraints: 4-6 hours spread across day; reduced during heavy rain.
  - name: knuckle_walk
    description: Move between feeding and resting sites using knuckle-walking gait.
    inputs: terrain_type, travel_distance
    outputs: position_update, energy_expenditure
    constraints: Preferred on firm ground; pace slows on steep or slippery terrain.
  - name: build_nest
    description: Gather branches and foliage to form nightly or midday nests.
    inputs: vegetation_availability, time_of_day
    outputs: resting_nest_ready
    constraints: Constructed daily near dusk; 5-15 minutes depending on material abundance.
  - name: social_groom
    description: Groom troop members to remove debris and reinforce bonds.
    inputs: partner_count, session_duration
    outputs: cleanliness_state, social_bond_strength
    constraints: 5-20 minute sessions multiple times per day; requires tolerant partners.
  - name: vocalize
    description: Produce hoots, grunts, or belches to coordinate or signal alarms.
    inputs: call_type, target_distance, context_threat_level
    outputs: group_alert_state, coordination_signal
    constraints: Alarm calls triggered by elevated threat; contact calls during travel or feeding breaks.
  - name: chest_beat_display
    description: Rapidly beat chest to intimidate rivals or warn intruders.
    inputs: threat_distance, intent_level
    outputs: intimidation_effect, deterrence_signal
    constraints: Typically performed by dominant individuals; brief bursts when threat is close.
