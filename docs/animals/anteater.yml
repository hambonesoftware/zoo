name: Giant Anteater
scientific_name: Myrmecophaga tridactyla
taxonomy:
  class: Mammalia
  order: Pilosa
  family: Myrmecophagidae
size:
  length: 1.8-2.4 m (nose to tail tip)
  weight: 33-50 kg
habitat: Grasslands, savannas, tropical forests, and wetlands
diet: Insectivorous (ants, termites)
capabilities:
  - elongated_tongue_with_adhesive_saliva
  - powerful_foreclaws
  - acute_olfaction
  - shaggy_coat_insulation
  - slow_metabolism
behaviors:
  - name: forage
    description: Track ant and termite mounds using olfaction while sweeping the ground at a slow, energy-efficient pace.
    inputs: terrain_type, scent_intensity, mound_density
    outputs: target_mound_location, energy_gain
    constraints: 8-10 hours per day; slower travel during midday heat; avoids saturated ground that collapses burrows.
  - name: tear_mound
    description: Use foreclaws to break open insect mounds or rotting logs to expose galleries.
    inputs: mound_hardness, mound_size
    outputs: opening_size, disturbance_alert
    constraints: 1-2 minutes per mound; limited to 2-3 consecutive mounds before resting claws to avoid injury.
  - name: tongue_feed
    description: Rapidly extend the tongue to gather ants and termites from an opened mound.
    inputs: insect_density, tongue_extension_time
    outputs: energy_gain, hydration_loss
    constraints: Up to 150 tongue flicks per minute; 40-60 seconds per feeding bout before relocating.
  - name: thermoregulate
    description: Seek shade, water edges, or ventilation to prevent overheating while foraging.
    inputs: ambient_temperature, shade_availability, humidity
    outputs: temperature_drop, reduced_activity
    constraints: Initiates above 30°C or high solar load; reduces movement speed by roughly 30% while active.
  - name: sleep
    description: Rest curled with the tail draped over the body for insulation and concealment.
    inputs: shelter_type, time_of_day
    outputs: energy_recovery, heat_retention
    constraints: 14-16 hours daily with midday preference; interrupted by high threat levels or heavy rain.
